# Kotlin Multiplatform Sample Weather App

This is a sample weather app made to play around with Kotlin Multiplatform. I tried to strive for maximum code sharing between platforms, all the business logic is shared. Only thing that is platform depended is the native UI. Jetpack Compose for Desktop and Android and SwiftUI for IOS.

This kind of architecture is only achiveable thanks to the work of 
Arkadii Ivanov and his libraries [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose) and [MVIKotlin](https://github.com/arkivanov/MVIKotlin).

Kotlin Multiplatform and libraries supporting it are highly violatile at the moment and in the early stages of development. It can be kinda a pain in the bottom to work with but nevertheless it has been a great experience. I can't wait to see what the future holds, I truly believe this will be the future of cross platform development. Just thinking about using Kotlin to develop a codebase shared across platforms is almost like a dream.




## Demo
